# MY DATA SCIENCE PORTOFOLIO
In this page, I would like to show my previous projects in data science role.

**- Machine Learning:**
  - Supervised learning:
    1. [Decrease Employee Attrition Rate](https://github.com/virgobase/my-portfolio/tree/485a9d5b4334e35eb2ad25800184bf8b8a0ebd55/Attrition%20Rate)--> This project focusing on how decrease attrition rate under 5%. Various algorithm being compared in terms of performance, and LightGBM decided to be used. This model could possibly decrease attrition rate from 16% down to around 2%. With this model, the company could save financial cost for hiring new employee.
    2. [Forecast Quantity Sold with ARIMA]()-->This project is focus on forecasting daily and monthly product quantity sold. In this project, a predictive model ARIMA is being used to forecast the product quantity. This is a part of Data Science Project-based Internship in Kalbe Nutritionals.
  - Unsupervised learning:
    1. [Clustering Airline Passenger](https://github.com/zerobase-one/my-portfolio/blob/main/Unsupervised%20Learning/Unsupervised_Learning.ipynb)--> This machine learning is focused on clustering airline passenger using K-Means algorithm. Given various features in this dataset but only 6 features used based on LRFMC model that suitable for airline industry.
    2. [Customer Segmentation with K-Means]()---> This project is trying to show best cluster composition from the dataset provided by Kalbe Nutritionals. With K-Means method, this project found that the best cluster to be reviewed and follow up by the company is 3 clusters. Each cluster have their own characteristics. The cluster determined by 3 features, 'count_transaction', 'total_qty' & 'amount_in_total'.
