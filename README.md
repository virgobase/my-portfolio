**- Machine Learning:**
  - Supervised learning:
    1. [Decrease Employee Attrition Rate](https://github.com/virgobase/my-portfolio/tree/485a9d5b4334e35eb2ad25800184bf8b8a0ebd55/Attrition%20Rate)--> This project focusing on how decrease attrition rate under 5%. Various algorithm being compared in terms of performance, and LightGBM decided to be used. This model could possibly decrease attrition rate from 16% down to around 2%. With this model, the company could save financial cost for hiring new employee.
